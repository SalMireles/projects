Also, being able to walk alone at night,  although it doesn'`t y feel like ten years will be enough to achieve that.  \r\nNot having to be okay with the bare minimum in terms of representation for women (India'`s first mainstream movie about lesbians passed the bechdel test because if ONE scene that lasted 60seconds).\r\nUnderstanding intersectional feminism within the Indian context - respect and opportunity for dalit women, Muslim women not being patronised for practising their religion.

121,"Real and consistent punishment for domestic abusers, abortion on demand, freedom of gender/sexual expression for women everywhere, real solutions to climate change being implemented globally. "

Women should have the same political autonomy and opportunity: the ability to enter politics and succeed in politics as often and as easily as men can. Women'`s bodies and health issues should no longer be political hot topics (for example, reproductive rights and supports must be a fundamental part of every country'`s health system). Social discrimination against women must end: no more negative stereotyping, and women must no longer be expected to fill a narrow set of societal positions (such as mother, caretaker, wife). Male violence, domestic abuse, and other forms of violence against must end. Clothing, media, and other items or ideas that are seen as feminine cannot be viewed as more shallow, more inferior, or worse in any way. Women'`s habits and mannerisms (such as uptalk and vocal fry) can no longer be framed as negative in any way. Women must also have total economic empowerment: women must be paid as much as men for the same work and must have the same chances for career advancement, regardless of their family situation. Career fields that are dominated by women can no longer be lower paying than those dominated by men. All this and more. "

Feeling, intuition is valued more & gets more space in daily life. \r\nCare work & typical female occupations are well paid. \r\n\r\nThe male ideal of macho is replaced. Through male role models who are compassionate, gentle & respectful of themselves & everyone else.\r\n\r\nMen are no longer excused for their actions with the explanation that they have been challenged by a provocative woman. Everyone takes responsibility for their own actions. Today, it is only a crime if the woman or the victim of sexual violence has said ""no"". That will be changed. Once it harms a person, it is a crime. \r\n\r\n There are brothels where men can work & women can go. \r\n\r\nThe two sexes respect each other. Without wanting to do the same. \r\n\r\nAll people are more in contact with themselves & thus also with their own feelings, desires, dreams. Through compassion for ourselves, we can'`t help but have compassion for other beings & nature. We no longer live against ourselves & therefore not against nature & against other people.\r\nIt is there in abundance everything we need to live. \r\n\r\nEvery life is equally valuable.

557,
558,"For the discussion to have changed from women achieving and breaking glass ceilings in a partriarchal society to having changed the constructs of society which hold women back to accommodate their needs. I.e. No women being hailed for achieving despite having kids, or despite her hormonal or biological needs and instead normalising time off for your period/PMS, more men actively taking paternity leave and splitting parental duties.

632,"At this point, where it seems that we'`re going backwards, progress would look like women'`s sex-based rights are respected and upheld, which DOESN'`T and clash with LGBTQ+ '`s community'`s demands. If there is a clash, there SHOULD be a debate, and solutions should not be one-sided. How can we talk about progress for women'`s human rights if we increasingly aren'`t allowed to have words and a language for ourselves? That has real-life consequences. "

728,
729,
730,
731,"It is normal for Parliaments, work places, committees to have women and people of colour who are paid the same and make up an equal proportion as white males. At work, women aren'`t immediately assumed to be aiming for children in their 30s, and if they are it shouldn'`t be an issue. There won'`t be negative connotations to '`like a girl'` that relates to being weak or less able than a male. To be referred to as a woman rather than a girl. That people shouldn'`t care what a person identifies as and what their sexual preference is. That women and girls don'`t fear that they will be sexually assaulted or raped when they go out. That we prevent wars and people are protected from sexual assault when they are vulnerable as civilians including refugees, immigrants, indigenous etc. That the education system teaches children about women and people of colour in science and technology, and girls are given equal opportunities in sport and not given '`girly'` options such as rounders and netball when they want to play cricket and basketball. That the politicians care more about equality and the environment, and we stop hating people that the media and politicians blame and start blaming the wealthy corporations and people who don'`t pay their taxes and destroy environments and don'`t pay their works."
732,
733,
734,
735,
736,Cultural respect for marginalised groups - so that they are no longer marginalised!
737,"I hope that in ten years at least the GPG will have improved. I don'`t think it'`s eliminated. The same applies to women (or diverse) in management positions. \r\n\r\n In addition, the issue of domestic violence must be eliminated or finally taken more seriously."
738,"Women being able to freely make decisions that men have already made without being judged. Sex workers being safe and respected. Black women being listened to in healthcare. Trans women being protected from hate crime, given access to “women’s only spaces” and a higher life expectancy for them "

"
743,More women in political office\r\nE recognition and corresponding wage and pension increase for care work done\r\n
744,Women around the world have gained female self-confidence. They are aware of how and by what means they can change societies and also know how to implement this. Each in its place and in your area. They have become partners who have also developed visions of living together. This is also because they are strengthened by other women and also some men. 
745,"Unconditional basic income. Equal pay, flexible working hours, 6-hour working days (as in Sweden), home office, job sharing. Less sexual assault, better education, free access to contraception, more support and counseling centers"

757,
758,Equality 100%
759,"Equal pay, distribution / support for raising children, many more women in politics and positions of power / leadership positions / decision-makers"
760,"I'`m not sure if I understand this Fage correctly. If this means whether women'`s human rights are more likely to be (not) implemented, I believe that there will rather not be much progress. Especially due to the corona crisis, women in particular have been hit hard, society is switching back to ""more traditional ideas"", i.e. the woman stays at home and takes care of the children in remote learning when they have children. In addition, women are still rather double burdened, ie they should not only work, but also everything related to the household, (children/family) under one roof and I dare to doubt that equality will settle there. \r\nIn addition, there is sexism, which is very present, so on our municipal council election lists several dubious women were listed as candidates, yet *not a single* made it into the municipal council! In other words, we have the same rights and possibilities on paper, but these are not really adopted into practice."
761,Hopefully even better!
762,Rather bad

773,
774,Being able to walk down any street or travel to any country without fear of being harassed because I'`m a woman. Being able to have healthy conversations about women'`s sexuality without being called a slut. Ensuring that were a global pandemic ever to happen again that it wouldn'`t threaten women'`s rights progress everywhere because they would be strong and advanced enough to withstand the threat.
775,"No pay gap, no motherhood penalty, no unpaid/unrecognised care work, no harassment"
776,"Equality of all genders not only on paper, but also in daily life."
777,Women will increasingly take what they want. Hopefully not in the same way that men used to do or tend to do.
778,"All women have access to education. They do not have to fear being discriminated against, harassed or subjected to violence because of their gender; it goes without saying that women can both have a family and live out their dreams at work. There are enough support services (such as affordable crèches, etc.), which make this possible and it is a matter of course that women make a career at work, even if they have a family. "
779,
780,"I wish that in 10 years women will not be controlled and tyrannized on the basis of their reproductive or other abilities, be it through the threat of violence, financial oppression or legal or socio-cultural restrictions to freely dispose of their own body and mind. "

786,"Full pay equality. Equal representation in parliament, cabinet, boards of ftse 100 companies. Most importantly, an inclusive societal commitment to end violence against women and girls. "
787,"I would like to see a profound political, cultural change in private and in society: violence and assaults, both inside and outside of relationships, should be massively reduced - through clear, victim-supporting legislation and a change towards a more loving, holistic perception, a real sense of equality, especially on the part of men, but also by strengthening the self-confidence and the will to fight of women."

810,A confident expectation present in womxn and girls that they can be treated equitably and with respect. 
811,Women enabled to excercise their rights and make right choice of their lives by themselves
812,I think it is important that as many girls as possible can go to school and learn and practice a profession.
813,
814,
815,Women can able to take more leadership position in 10 years
816,
817,Improvements constantly but too slowly

842,"I can only say that in 10 years I hope that in 10 years there will also be better protection against rape and abuse in Switzerland: stricter laws and yes is yes law introduce, more protection such as women'`s shelters. In general, I hope that by then these issues will be de-stigmatized and everyone will talk about them openly. I hope that rape victims will be taken more seriously, no matter what gender they are. "

1203,10 years from now women are not seen as other to men and are afforded recognition for the positive difference they bring to society rather than being controlled and vilified for it. Individuals are celebrated for their contribution and enabled to be true to themselves without fear of reprisal.  Women are economic equals as the gender pay gap has been closed and policies are enacted that support parity and significantly ensure parental equity.

The first world which is way ahead of us still has a lot of issues like sportswomen being paid less, Americans got their first woman VP now in the 21st century. The space to advocate for women’s rights has shrunk and the audience for such might not really be there.

If children are educated with equality and inclusion at the heart of teaching, we will have a better society. Sex education at school level needs to include female pleasure, LGBT education and consent. I believe free universal child care will break down many barriers that women face in the workplace.

Economic barriers for women have been greatly reduced and the impacts of global capitalism are being addressed, with a global economy that serves the majority not the minority, and where women'`s economic freedom is central to growth in the way that GDP is today.

Women are able to fight for their sex-based rights without fear of being chased out of jobs, harrassment or attacks and access women-only spaces. I hope that pornography is heavily regulated and that it is not possible for people to view women being raped. In line with this, countries follow the nordic model and sex buying is no longer commonplace and is  not accepted. In lieu of this, trafficking reduces and women are seen as people, not commodities. Women'`s sex based rights are enshrined in laws and gender based violence decreases, including domestic abuse and sexual assault. Women have greater economic power. Women are able to access legal routes when they have been abused or attacked and can expect a fair trial where issues such as fight, flight and flop response are well known. Convictions for DV and sexual assault rise due to better legal systems and these issues decrease."

1483,In this country it'`s not promising. Even the women in the top parliament seats are doing nothing about it. They talk buy less action. Very few people are on empowering the girl child. Women are ignorant and no one is educating them on such topics
1484,
1485,"Women that are empowered to make informed decisions about their bodies and their lives be it in a marriage or in general public, also, medically. A woman should be able to choose whether she wants children or not without being questioned and women should be able to choose whether they want to keep the baby or not in the case she gets pregnant"
1486,"I think important issues are access to reproductive technology (support for intentional pregnancy & abortions), the legal & social equality of lesbian & trans women and that we stop talking only about women in anti-sexist & anti-patriarchal struggles, but all FLINT (women, lesbians, inter, non-binary, trans) people think along, give space and do not let ourselves be played off against each other."

Tech that is funded and devoted toward this cause, and that offers women equal opportunities to men to join the fight without misogyny, discrimination, or accusations of being a ""diversity hire"" who is somehow not qualified. \r\n\r\n"
1498,"Woman'`s sex-based rights are acknowledged and protected in law. Sex as an immutable characteristic and protected class is acknowledged by society. Women aren'`t censored, threatened, nor harmed for disagreeing. Women aren'`t sacrificed for the feelings and desires of male people. "

1505,Good
1506,It is very promising. Women are taking a stand across the globe and making efforts to advocate for their rights. We should be close to achieving gender equality in 10 years or atleast we should have made significant progress
1507,Equality remains a long way off. Maybe 25 years

Also, gender-based violence is a thing of the past, and abortion & sex education is no longer considered illegal/inappropriate, but essential for whole well-being."
1555,"Well...  I have real fears that women'`s rights in the west will be undermined by including male born people with female born women. Failing to ensure that sex is the primary data point against which things should be recorded will mean we will not be able to measure violence against women, pay gaps, sporting achievements, allocation of funding and will not be able to ensure that women have safe spaces where they are safe from male gaze and male violence. We should not be defined by social roles, norms or expectations which are imposed on us by society, this is harmful to both sexes of all orientations. We should all be able to present however we feel without being constrained by external definitions or have labels assigned to us but until women hold equal share of voice, money, capital and power in every country in the world, we should not stop measuring the gaps and striving to close them.

1584,"The majority of the world understands that women should have full and total autonomy over their bodies, their decisions and their futures. Marriage no longer includes a sense of ownership and sex is understood to be a consensual act that both/all parties enter into with equal power and enjoyment. A more sophisticated understand of domestic abuse that includes coercive control and manipulation as tools of gender-based violence. "

We should teach our young boys better, so that they'`ll not be like their fathers.

Women should occupy positions of leadership in powerful companies and in government and should be respected in those positions. I expect more women to not be restricted by societal gender roles and break into powerful fields and industries and have successful careers. I also hope that laws and legislation are revised to fully protect women from sexual harrassment in all areas of life, in homes, work place or streets. There is also need to develop effective agencies or organisations that fully support women who are victims of GBV and rape. Then there is also need for women to see their perpetrators being fully held accountable and punished by the law. Ultimately there is should be advancement in the independence of women socially, politically, financially, economically and education-wise and also protection for them against rapists, rape apologists and sexual harassers within our society."

1828,
1829,
1830,"Everybody understood that quotas for women in the work context are a useful instrument. Equality for women in context of family care work and paid professionaly work is the norm in families and supported by political measures like equal parental leave pay. Prejudice about how women and men have to be, became overall less and more people are standing up against comments about it in public and in private."
1831,"This depends heavily on socio-economic, educational and political issues. It is difficult to talk about this since in my country the macho and patriarchal traits prevail and the lack of politics for this purpose is very remote."
1832,"The current circumstances are very different, therefore difficult to speak in an answer for the whole world.\r\n\r\n- no more forced sterilizations & circumcisions \r\n- Abortion rights \r\n- Rape is considered a crime everywhere \r\n- Self-determination in all areas: sexuality, work, etc."
1833,
1834,"Women will make better choices for themselves by waiting to have sex, getting good educations and job training, and choosing responsible, dedicated husbands.  Governments will provide opportunities for, and not purposely hinder the ability of, women to make good decisions for themselves.  Governments and private entities will empower women to both carry their pregnancies to term and succeed in life by enabling education and job training opportunities, affordable child care, and providing aid during economic slumps."

1932,"Continuous revisitation of abortion in every presidential election causes great concern for me.  They'`re still talking about women'`s reproductive right to choose what is best for them at the time they discover tg hem are pregnant. An illness may cause a very risky pregnancy and perhaps it'`s a result of incest, or rape.  It should not be a nation'`s decision as it is a very personal issue.  Yet, I think because it'`s a womans right.... the powers that be see no problem in the consideration of regulating the rights to choose for women.  "
1933,

1935,"Queer women have rights. \r\nTrans women are not denied their womanhood.\r\nAll working women are paid fairly, in comparison to men.\r\nEveryone who can get pregnant has access to reproductive healthcare.\r\nThose who wish to abort caj do so in a healthy, legal manner."
1936,Women'`s human rights would be an achieved target in 10 years to come.
1937,"A shift in social norms change to reject violence against women, and hold men accountable for perpetuating this violence. A shift in social norms to see men step up and play an equal role in child raising and domestic work. \r\n\r\nAn expansion of social protection globally so that all women have the financial security to make decisions about their own lives. "

1944,
1945,"I see a vigorous progession of a goal driven and headstrong woman. However, I fear an existence of an over represented and protected female where the coin will be flipped if boundaries for boundaries in equality are set. The idea is to have balance of genders. "
1946,It look achieveable
1947,"That women are interdependently self sufficient; economically, Socially & politically mobilised & enabled through local and global systemic changes that centres the importance of  empowered women. \r\n\r\nSystemic changes that are holistic, that caters to the needs of every woman in a entirety, so that she may lead, create, birth, serve and move unencumbered. And the world will recognise this a female birthright. "

1962,"Equal pay, proper equality, appropriate treatment, less sexism"
1963,"I hope women will have reproductive freedom, where they have access to free birth control and health care decisions,  are their own, not governed by laws.\r\nThat will will see young girls having more opportunities in traditionally male held fields.\r\nThat women will have equal pay for equal work,\r\nThat women will have paid time off to care for their children.

True informed consent in medical issues like abortion & vaccination (over 70% of women say they felt pressured into abortion, they need to know they have other options). Protection of biological female sports (it is unfair for biological female to have to compete against biological males). Respect for women who choose traditional roles such as raising a family. "

So many other things, the right to go to school and not worry about your period, the right to speak up about sexual abuse and be taken seriously and have faith in the justice system, the ability to work in any sector and not worry about being seen as a liability for the possibility of getting pregnant.

2127,
2128,
2129,Women'`s reproductive rights are no longer up for debate or dependent on which administration is currently in power.

Woman who choose motherhood would not be denigrated and both genders would not be burdened with taxes funding government waste but what will happen is there will be more waste, higher taxes, more ridicule and denigration of traditional and/or religious women and women'`s sports will no longer exist.

The impact can only be felt if there is no interference. Eg. The long term adverse effects of abortion and contraceptives. None of this information is as widely spread as the short term '`solutions'` these factors tend to portray.\r\n\r\nIn terms of gender based violence: progress looks like a good judiciary system that will work on perpetrators fairly. It will also look like equipping women mentally and economically to avoid situations where they feel helpless and have to stay in abusive relationships or situations all in the name of not having an alternative\r\n\r\nProgress in terms of education: that all children are able to access quality education. Young girls in rural Kenya settle for early marriage as they see no alternative to life.\r\n\r\nSanitary towels: young girls I have interacted with will exchange sex for money to buy sanitary towels."

Women should be able to have the same pay as men for the same Job, if they underwent the same education, as it is only fair. We should also be able to actually be partners with our spouses in marriage rather than have one where the man dictates and the woman submits, men should also be able to recognise this, in order to have more fruitful relationships. I also look forward to women actually being able to be given the chance to further their education to whatever level they hope, rather  than having it that at least you reached high school. I also look forward to seeing more women in government positions, we cant have men occupying 90% of government positions yet 50% of the population are women, it is only fair and just. Not saying that men are not aware of gender based issues, but it is only fair that these problems are catered to by fellow women, who have actually experienced being a woman and understand the struggles.

3201,If worked upon positively success is To shine
3202,"I hope for better, currently there'`s alot to consider in my home area. Women aren'`t aware and those who know show little interest in standing up for women'`s rights. Culture also plays a bigger role placing men at a better advantage over women!\r\nIn 10years I hope women would have gained enough courage, sensitisation, legal support and financial back to stand for women'`s rights!"

3441,"1. Women being able to own successful businesses without being called promiscuous (because of the assumption she used sex to get to the top).\r\n2. Women not being pressured into marriage because they are not doing well in school (women often work all day long from a young age and this affects their grades).\r\n3. Women not being blamed for the crimes of men (rape, harrassment, GBV).\r\n4. A curriculum focused on educating both men and women on women being equal counterparts equally deserving of respect (we need to undo the cultural damage in the arena of the classroom. Most of these teachings occur between elders and young people, and transfers between peers).\r\n5. The end of Female Genital Modification among Zambian women. Although this is a widely common practice, it'`s a taboo topic. It'`s taboo in the Churches, as many Churches do not want to interfere with tradition (even if it'`s harmful), lest women become ""disobedient""."
3442,"The existance of effective, working mechanisms for protection, support and ending of violence and harassment in the home and elsewhere, instutional support and prioritisation of the issue"
3443,Women'`s empowerment imaging a success
3444,
3445,It will depend coz some women don'`t want to talk about what they are going through so am not so sure

3457,"In the next 10 years, woman'`s human rights will not be as effective as they are to be. Women are still looked at as an object than a person. Without having to do anything women cannot get where they want to be as that a favor is asked in return."
3458,I don'`t see a future because politicians don'`t care about youth and our children 
3459,"If we try to let people do their work without any political interference then it will be great.... If we can find a cure for Covid, I see crime levels reducing and people'`s lives going back to normal."

3470,"Well,I believe we shall be in a better world,forexample in my country the population is mainly made up of women and youths and so a progress in women'`s rights will definitely develop this country(Uganda)we won'`t have women depending on men for everythingwhich is the case right now.,I'`m looking at freedom of speech,  freedom to choose marriage partners (this will bring about love,peace and less abuse in homes).the right to education which will create a more civilised society, other than the early marriages, birth at a young age(with all the risks like fistula which is too much now),.. All i see is a better WORLD..."
3471,"I think it is progressing in the right direction, but at a very slow pace. My country does not really consider women'`s rights as a top priority and most of the time push it back at the political agenda.\r\nI believe the work in the ground is getting the right attention, but the policies are not supporting the work. Overall it is a positive outlook. "
3472,

3503,It'`s going to be too slow 
3504,
3505,It'`s promising women are becoming active every day
3506,More women educated about their rights. More women in positions of leadership from the grassroots to top government positions. More women able to make decisions regarding their welfare without interference from men. More men and boys getting on board to advance gender issues for peaceful communities.

3518,"It looks like a promising factor, as many will have the opportunity to express themselves with confidence without any barriers "
3519,
3520,"That the term '`women'`s rights'` be an outdated term because the rights belong to every person, regardless of sex, race, religious affiliation or choice. I want women to know that a partner or child does not define them. That their culture and traditions, mostly enforced by men, is secondary to who they are and should not infringe on their rights or force them into situations where they are uncomfortable. "
3521,Hoping for a drastic change
3522,"We see women being given and actually utilising similar opportunities as for men, therefore it'`s promising to see equal rights equal opportunities for all in 10years time "

3529,A society that looks up to women for action and accept opinions that come from women. One which does not lay down the future for girls but the girl is in charge of their future. One that does not follow culture backgrounds but is open for change.. 
3530,
3531,
3532,"It will help to educate the girl child concerning their rights, because as long as they are not educated it will be very difficult for them to understand things"
3533,
3534,"I feel a good mumber will have been empowered but for sustainability, good policies and collective support is necessary"
3535,
3536,"I see women standing up for themselves in economics, political and social circles. Women are now the bread winners and advocates in different sectors, so in 10 years they will be stronger to lead, guide and provide global transforming decisions.\r\n"

3569,
3570,"Free and easy access to abortion and birth control. Medical studies and advancements focused on women'`s sexed bodies, not men'`s. And economic power for women which would enable us to be able to leave poor domestic situations and have far greater self-determination."

3597,"I see women knowing more about their human rights and standing firm so as not to allow any one to take their rights away. I also see more organizations coming on board to educate, support and protect women and girl children in issues pertaining to their human rights"

3600,
3601,We will be able to educate people on there right and will fully get to understand what there rights are . It will progress because the people will share different ideas for it to move forward.

Race should never be a bargaining tool for anybody. Sanitary products should be free, financially woman are on the backfoot already from an early age as they have to pay for it.  All girl children should have the right to an education."
3645,
3646,"Progress for women'`s human rights would look like in Papua New Guinea, women being able to get top positions, through their own hardwork and sweat. They are given opportunities without having to justify why being a women should get that opportunity, and not being joked at that it is only for men. This is not a joking matter or subject. There is time for joking and the right place. Not in a working environment or to the person who is reporting to you and inquiring about that opportunity."

3788,
3789,"Women feeling safe in public spaces, being believed first when they speak up about their unpleasant experiences and seeing perpetrators being held accountable for their actions. I'`d also like to see a world in which women are given the opportunity to practise safe abortions and make other body autonomous decisions."

They will not blame the victim of the rape. Parents will be more conscious of the upbringing of the girl as a person, rather than as a gender representative with their responsibilities and will stop beating their heads into the ideology of sacrifice for the sake of marriage. Girls will raise their salaries on an equal basis with men and will not be promoted in the increase as well as men.

In our society, it is generally accepted that the girl herself is to blame, and I do not think that anything will change in 10 years. Now everyone says that the girl does not dress so-and-so that the girls themselves provoke, and no one wants to understand that no one gave men the right to rape against her will, no matter how the girl was dressed and behaved.

I know little about the situation with women'`s rights around the world, I can judge by the situation in Russia. For me, the breakthrough will be when the girls and women and girls themselves will respect their own and the male sex. When respect will be both their own and others'` borders. Of the issues concerning my country, I would like the interests of women to be better protected by the state. That domestic violence or violence on the street, anywhere, was punished. Now in my country, women can rarely win such a trial. And as a rule, their lives are already broken. I'`m glad there are community centers and foundations that are trying to help them.

6382,In 10 yrs. IF the trans ideology Cult has been exposed for its evil intents & died a good (total) death then Women’s Rights may be on the road to recovery & even possible progress.\r\nHowever if politicians continue to run scared of the trans activist violent extremist lobby (with their policy captures) then it will only take a year before ALL of Women’s sex-‘protected’ Civil/Human Rights have been totally annihilated and co-opted by ‘ intact’ or altered men (who pretend to be women). THIS ISSUE is THE Human Rights issue of the 21st. century - because it affects ALL Women & also children. At least 50% of the worlds population - & politicians (men) don’t care or are scared to be labelled transphobic by saying let’s try to find a solution to trans Demands that doesn’t end up erasing women

6655,"In Ireland, progress for me looks like my daughter arriving home from school and is excited to tell me that she learnt her body is a sacred instrument, that contains capacity for erotic pleasure. That an exploration of her body sexually is not shameful, and that it is not a solely dangerous or risky endeavour but a normal rite of passage for humans to discover themselves alone, or  with others if they so choose. Progress would look like intimate-partner violence and abuse (physical, mental, verbal) is not tolerated. Schools  would teach my daughter that relationships are based on respect and equality, and if she read the news she would learn that Ireland invests money in domestic abuse shelters for women and children, and in rehabilitation money for them, and the partner who committed this violence. Progress would look like my daughter finding it normal to have friends who question their assigned gender from birth. Progress would look like less women needing fertility treatment because of the negative impacts of air pollution. Progress would look like Ireland not having direct provision centers. Progress would look like free childcare. Progress would look like partners of children being given six months off work that they *must* take off within the first five years of their child'`s life. Progress would look like maternity interventions decreasing (for example C-section rates decreasing from 30% to 10%), and that we increase the availability of home-births. The rates of breastfeeding would increase (currently, we have the lowest rates in the world) and the number of lactation consultants would be increased. "
6656,Child marriage has ended everywhere.  A Women'`s right to  control her reproduction is accepted everywhere.  There is gender equality.

6699,"Having sovereignty over my life, not being punished for who I happen to be"
6700,"My vision for women and minorities in 10 years is to be on a level plain where they are valued and treated with the same dignity as men.  A time where women have domain over their body and mind; choosing for themselves what is best for their own health and welfare.    Where all genders/races evolve as a society of mutual respect safe from abuse, torture, trafficking, exclusion, and inequality.  "
6701,Women are at all levels in the organization and government and equal pay is no longer an issue.
6702,Progress looks like a society where women'`s careers aren'`t stifled because they choose to have children. Progress looks like a culture that doesn'`t accept domestic abuse or human trafficking and is united in working to stamp it out. \r\nProgress is a place where my mixed daughters don'`t have to worry about being looked at as potential shoplifters simply because of the color of their skin. \r\nProgress is a place where my girls and their girls feel empowered to dream big and where they feel confident in their ability to achieve those dreams alongside a society that supports them in their pursuit of those dreams.

6714,No hiring discrimination so women will have a chance of purposeful work as the woman sees it; have a choice of what to do with their bodies; and the political-cultural structures that trap women are abolished (where women are owned in Islamic countries)
6715,"Women worldwide have equal standing and respect as their male counterparts in the where they live, work and play. "
6716,Uncertain about that.

7581,
7582,
7583,"I do not have the slightest idea, well we have to be realistic, we are currently going through such difficult situations, sadly the problem is not politics, education and so on, the problems are us each of the Venezuelans in my case, We have a shitty policy that does not do if not think about their own needs and unfortunately we all have them and because the Venezuelan people the only solution there was for this problem was stealing from each other. It also happens with this issue of gender violence everything we keep silent we live in a strong and resounding silence that imprisons us and takes away our freedom, which makes us more vulnerable and manipulable, we have no initiatives or courage to face our situations of the day, we are ""getting used to"" this, we are a ball of puppets and tidal. \r\n And tell me what you are!\r\n\r\nWe need a change we, each of us. Change yourself and thus change your environment."
7584,I imagine empowered women actively participating in politics to change the reality that afflicts us today. From all areas supporting our children and so that their education is the foundation of the social change we need 
7585,
7586,
7587,"The human rights of women in ten years it is sad to imagine, how we are going in the educational part is deficient, we talk about protecting women but it is not educated for it, it focuses on the empowerment of women, who are able to do any work that a man does, but what is fundamental for a society that is the rescue of the family is being left aside. Wonderful women who have become successful in their jobs but their homes are abandoned, and the formation of the home, the children in a total abandonment, passing the responsibility to the schools that lack educators suitable to form in values, where children and young people grow up without a true ethical and moral formation because the most important thing for many is to encourage the liveliness and the capture of wealth regardless of how,  where to teach self-respect and respect for your neighbor is set aside if it affects the economic benefit, not to mention the struggle for freedom of choice that is rather a struggle for debauchery where the abuses of alcohol, drugs, sex, physical violence, verbal violence reign to all who intend to correct situations. Seriously it is necessary to resume the importance of the concept of family, which is the main cell of society, when its importance is recognized, work will begin for its rescue, which is fundamental the role of women for the success of a family but responsibility of men as well. Because the traditional concept is mother, father and children and that is the real concept. The rest for me is dysfunctional, the rest are life choices or adaptations to the circumstances that arise. "

I am very sorry to be so pessimistic, but where I live (Italy) it seems with every passing day that the ""crystal ceiling"" is becoming more and more a ""steel ceiling"", even with all the efforts that women in my country pour for their rights."

The areas we live and work; our communities, will look like us.  We will be represented and have a voice and opportunities.  We will have choice.  "
7933,
7934,
7935,Most of the people in charge of countries or people (as in companies) would be women. Women know how to organise better the world. More love and less conflicts\r\n
7936,A global acceptance of the need to increase access to education to enable sustainable economic equality. Without the means to generate your own income to support yourself and your dependents you are powerless. This must change.

7985,
7986,Women'`s voice will be loud and audible.  Women will be in high positions.  Women will be making a  great impact in the society. They will be unstoppable 
7987,Their rights will be equal to that of men
7988,Women will be able to get full right and access as men do

8016,It looks interesting and developed 10yrs from now
8017,"I try to be hopeful, but given the treatment of survivors of sexual assault in the past and most recently, I can'`t see much change.  The government in Australia is incredibly patriarchal, and unfortunately I can'`t see this attitude changing a great deal in ten years."

8019,Free from violence 
8020,
8021,
8022,To me I think by 10years time. Women'`s human rights will be far more ahead and women will be more aware of their rights.
8023,
8024,

Yet again, in order for the female population to achieve high recognition, and inclusivity rates, we need to address the stereotypes projected by dogmas (religions) which favors the patriarchy. Thus, it is of great importance to achieve the highest possible disengagement of the states from religion. I strongly believe that this would be a crucial step towards change. And, partially this would be great progress for the movement. If achieved within the decade then I believe that it will be a decade of continuous evolvement not just for women, rather than for societies at large."

Women were granted the right to vote here in the '`70s. In the Appenzeller Canton in the 90s!!! You will be amazed how things are here.\r\nThe pandemic had pushed women back to the kitchen and to bearing the majority of household loads.\r\n\r\nIn the years, I hope to see here a mandatory paternal leave when children are born. I want to see longer maternal leave for women. Women have to be protected during pregnancy and not at risk of being fired and forced to work. I hope that the German model will be taken as reference.\r\nMoreover, I hope that Swiss women will have more access to other societal models and have courage to take lead, be in more higher positions on companies and institutions woth decisive powers. There is a general silence here. Those who speak up are not seen well. "

More women in power - particularly in big political roles (looking at Jacinda Ardern as a shining example). "
8451,
8452,Equity for all genders and races. A  higher percentage of men in caregiver roles. Girls not having limitations placed on them at a young age.

It is about the fact that woman and man are different, but that both live out their values and their peculiarities in such a way that both feel valued. \r\nz.B. as a woman, you are already naturally connected to the cycle and the moon, the intuitive part, only through the period. This should be appreciated.\r\nMany women think but only that they are equal if they only work all the time, and neglect this part. \r\nI mean I personally also feel weak myself, to just want to have a break and peace in our society during my cycle, because I think it is important to appreciate my natural rhythm.\r\nIt are many things that have to and should change, and even if the mountain often still seems VERY big, it depends on the small things.\r\nOn the whole I believe and hope for a better future for all (:"

Women receive the same working conditions and wages. Women need to get more into leadership positions. Conservative forces must be weakened and progressive policies must prevail. People'`s thinking has to change - that is, we have to change our language, because it is an expression of our thinking and only in this way can we make feminist ways of thinking the norm. After all, out of this thinking, politics must change in such a way that women are 100% equal. No ifs or buts."

That the political and systemic structures and ways of thinking are improving in such a way that women do not unintentionally become financially dependent on a man as soon as they have children, nor get into overload situations if they want to/ have to stay in working life with children, nor that they are threatened with poverty in old age, although many pursue a little appreciated and seen full-time activity throughout their lives. \r\n"

In addition, we must actively work to break out of stereotypical thought patterns, and above all to educate our children gender-neutral, so that the generation of tomorrow does not have to struggle with the same prejudices as we do! We need systemic change, i.e. women'`s quotas have to be established, as e.B. now for German board members. In addition, politics must also become more feminine - a highly equal presidential team!!! Male/female dual leaders and management teams, because together we are even more :)\r\nCare work must be paid, otherwise women will always do a large part of their work free of charge, and will not be valued for it."

However, my optimism reaches its limits. "
9750,

9788,"All women are equal, earn as much as men and are protected from sexual/physical/psychological violence. No more forced marriages etc and abortions are in the woman'`s own decision about her body. "
9789,
9790,I don'`t see any progress as long as girls and boys are still mutilated or shambled for religious (cultural) reasons and as long as the decision-makers are convinced that women cannot be equal.

9794,"Depending on the economic situation. Fact for me, starting a family and having children are and remain a trap for women!"
9795,we are stagnating
9796,"With us it will improve because we can educate our girls more self-determined and self-confident and the boys to more respect. In the rest of the world, it depends on further political developments. If this continues, I am seriously concerned about progress!"

9798,
9799,Slightly beser

9830,"I am realistic, it will take much longer to achieve equality of people in all respects."
9831,
9832,
9833,"I think women'`s rights have made the most progress in all categories. In 10 years, hopefully every woman will be paid exactly as much as her male employees. I also hope that forced marriages will be abolished everywhere. Rapes of little girls should no longer be tolerated in any cultures and their sterilization must also be topped. This is exactly how every woman should be able to act of her own will. In 10 years, there should be no more discussion about whether someone is wearing a skirt that is too short or a burqa/niqab."
9834,"By then, we will have the point where men will have to emancipate themselves, as women (in the industrialized countries) have become what they once rightly fought - namely oppressors!"
9835,Equality in the executive floors and in terms of wages. Well-founded childcare services
9836,
9837,"Advances in equality of all genders, religions, ethics, etc."

9844,Finally equality and no more discrimination; this starts with receiving the same salary with the same education and does not end where women are no longer treated as inferior and as a sexual object.
9845,I hope better than today.  \r\nFatherhood leave? I have little hope. 
9846,hopefully much better than today - 
9847,Hopefully the progress will be implemented by then!
9848,

9853,
9854,

9858,"Much better than today. The reason for this are the current social movements such as feminist organizations, etc."
9859,"Equal pay in all sectors, shared parental leave (which must be at least 3 months) so that women are not discriminated against when applying or have opportunities for advancement, more protection for women who belong to cultural minorities, more women in management positions without quotas! "

9861,"Absolute equality. Equal rights and equal obligations. Equal career opportunities, equal pay! All people are taken seriously. Parental leave not maternity leave. Abolition of conscription for all. "
9862,
9863,Very confident that women and men will be put on an equal footing...

9867,
9868,
9869,
9870,A completely new system with trade is needed! No more money that drives everyone crazy!

9875,unfortunately little progress
9876,Hopefully better
9877,"A fair opportunity. This means equal opportunities on the labour market (parental leave, equal wages, flexible working models for all, etc.), violence prevention and acceptance of society, that in the case of violence of all kinds, the victim is not to blame."
9878,Better
9879,"Equal wages, equal rights, respect"
9880,
9881,"Appreciation and respect of every woman, regardless of age, religion, skin color, nationality, sexual orientation. Everyone should have the opportunity to strive for education, economic independence and personal happiness.

9882,
9883,Equality in every respect
9884,
9885,"If we join forces, we are STRONG and so we will herald systemically important corrections."
9886,I can'`t say. 
9887,no physical and psychological oppression. Provide access to education

9890,
9891,
9892,
9893,
9894,"Gender-neutral application processes, no obligation to provide evidence in the event of abuse, easier reporting of harassment, abuse, etc. Psychological support in the police, worldwide campaigns, maternity and paternity leave 1year, defined wage levels thus no differences between men and women"
9895,
9896,
9897,"Rather sluggish, as there is a lot of bureaucracy and social norms"
9898,
9899,
9900,"In ten years, progress will be slightly advanced. By law, many things are clearly better formulated in favor of women and anchored in law, but the implementation in everyday life, the (conscious) change in people'`s behavior unfortunately still lags - this step needs a lot of awareness, education and self-reflection."
9901,"Equal pay for equal work. Nonviolent communication - conscious, freed from sexism, racism and any exclusion. "
9902,
9903,"progressing and better, but still too little"
9904,
9905,Equal pay
9906,Hopefully better. Especially in patriarchal countries
9907,"There is no longer any question that there is equal pay, care work is paid (for the person who is at home) and women are strong, independent, cannot be told or deceived. We raise our daughters and sons to be strong personalities without all these clichés because that'`s for boys and that'`s for girls. It starts on the playground! "
9908,more women in key positions
9909,
9910,"Equal pay, from 3% to 10% Proportion of women in management positions in Switzerland'`s 100 largest employers"
9911,Every woman is free to know what she wants to do and leave without having to justify herself.
9912,
9913,"In 10 years, human rights should no longer have to be an issue for EVERYONE!"
9914,
9915,
9916,Being recognized as a parent not as a working mother. Being truly free to choose whether to have kids or not. \r\nHaving free access to childcare! More women (at least 35%) in senior management positions 
9917,"Equal pay, respect and respect "
9918,
9919,
9920,"We will still not be fully on an equal footing, as there must still be a number of government requirements, such as control of wage transparency, parental leave, promotion of part-time work, etc."
9921,Equality\r\nViolent-free\r\nProgress instead of regression
9922,
9923,"Equality of all people before the law and in all private and public matters. In other words, equal rights and obligations, such as equal pay for equal work, small wage gaps between top and low earners. Consideration for our environment, promotion of biodiversity, long-term healthy energy supply. Each of us must have access to education. Etc. "
9924,I hope that by then we will all have the same rights as men.
9925,"more leading women in politics, business and media  "
9926,
9927,
9928,"We have no choice but to break down all the barriers that prevent women from participating in society, because only if everyone can have a say will our society be fully functional. And it has to be in order to survive the selection of crises we are heading for."
9929,
9930,When we have finally managed to ensure that men * and women * are not only equal on paper. When it is politically and culturally anchored that we are all human beings with the same rights and that this is accepted and lived by everyone.
9931,That you finally make no difference whether someone is a man or a woman and everyone has the same opportunities in all areas
9932,There will no longer be a difference in rights and justice between the sexes. All rights and justice for all genders!
9933,
9934,"I hope that in 10 years women will have the same opportunities and wages as men!\r\nFurthermore, I hope that a woman without fear can do what she wants in the evening and leave what she wants"
9935,
9936,
9937,"Flexible working hours and locations and providers, husband and wife carry 50/50 household/children/life admin (mental load). Women always earn exactly the same as men, no harassment/harassment/mansplaining. Women can walk through the city at night without queasy feeling, rape is not the first thing you ask what kind of clothes you wear, children and adolescents grow up with equal parents, no matter what the composition is, basic income for everyone, women do not have to behave like men to rise in the profession, taboo topic period is no longer taboo, proper sexual education for all"
9938,"Women worldwide receive full self-determination over their bodies, know sexual harassment only from the past and are treated equally like men. "
9939,I hope that we reach a point where women are equal to men in all respects and everyone can decide for themselves about their own body (in all respects). This also applies to the law in which formulations such as man/woman are replaced by humans. But I don'`t think we'`ll achieve that in 10 years.
9940,No significant change
9941,"Unfortunately, it is very difficult for me to judge this, because I still noticed that in the 70s there was an upswing in countries where women no longer count for anything today and that women began to liberate themselves at that time. That later declined again and violence against women has risen sharply. If you look at pictures from Iran in the 70s, for example, you would not dream that it is a Muslim country, compared to today, the women there are much worse off and they have been pressed back into old roles. I hope that the rights for women will be better in 10 years, but honestly, I dare to doubt that..."
9942,modest
9943,
9944,
9945,Gender equality increasingly implemented

We live in a global society that is committed to the future of a livable planet for all* in the sense of social sustainability, also on an ecological and economic level!"
9969,that it goes without saying that women are 50% involved in all committees. Equal pay for equal work. That the fear of strong women has disappeared...
9970,"Very bad, as women'`s rights are being revoked by the pandemic."
9971,The understanding of young women and men for the topic and the self-understanding to demand equal rights for themselves as women. Cultural change in the feeling and thinking of the sexes.
9972,
9973,Equality in all areas of life
9974,"Domestic and care work is part of GDP/GDP! Raising children is no longer a matter for the mother. Women are plus-minus 50:50 in leadership positions, politics, decision-making positions, etc. "
9975,"People will recognize and finally understand intersectional feminism and eventually turn away from it forever. The individual will be resurrected and the pigeonholed identity politics will be forgotten with its weak, sad followers."

9977,bad
9978,
9979,
9980,Personally: To be able to walk at night without worrying about who else is around me. Travel on public transport without being touched. To be believed by my doctor if I go in and ask about my health - especially when it comes to '`womens'` issues'`. To be empowered in my work place - to be given access to training and development in '`male oriented skill areas'` like development and code. \r\nGlobally: for women to have more access to better healthcare - including sanitary places like toilets and access to sanitary products. For women to have fair pay rights. For women to feel safer.
9981,
9982,"Unfortunately bad, because politics sleeps, denies and chases after the short success."
9983,Women and men must do everything they can globally to ensure that women'`s human rights actually improve considerably. From 1 - 10: 6

Equality = equal rights for all, without *but*.  There should *never* be a but. But each one is too much when it comes to such topics: ""I have nothing against foreigners, but ..."" Nope! No but!\r\n\r\nDer, this view is not very realistic, especially if it is supposed to arrive in 10 years.\r\n\r\nI think by then, we may have achieved \r\n– that sex offenders receive a proper punishment;\r\n– that something like paternity leave is considered normal;\r\n– that the work of the parent who stays at home,  is considered valuable and wholesome; \r\n– that the suffering + dying of people may be seen as a single drama, regardless of *how* they have suffered/died;\r\n– that we finally devote time to climate change and our role in it and present working solutions (CO2 = in 2050, is ridiculous when we already reached the melting point ""of no return"" in the Arctic last year);\r\n– that the economy,  or economic growth, which is no longer valued so highly and we can thus leave the values and views of the ""boomer"" generation behind us.\r\n\r\n Above all, however, I wish that humanity understands that if you give/allow/shake hands with others, you yourself will not become poorer or more disadvantaged. She should understand that the ""good old times"" were not better, but the people there were younger.\r\nOmething of the most important thing seems to me, however, that it is understood that changes are part of life, that not everything can remain as before. Everything is subject to constant change, which should not instill fear, but as an opportunity for change in a hopefully better future.\r\n\r\nFinding, my greatest hope for 10 years (especially after this corona pandemic) would be that the value of a human life, or the value of life in general, will be recognized and respected - regardless of other criteria."

The same opportunities need to be given to young girls (and boys) from every background to even the playing field and allow women from all different backgrounds and abilities to thrive.

10180,"I would like to look optimistically and positively into the future of women and I will never lose faith. The developments worldwide so far are unbelievable to observe but also frightening! There is still so much ignorance and disinterest in this very important topic and the ignorance is very great. I think 10 years is far too short a period of time to be able to foresee a quasi-glorious future. It will take 2-3 more generations before serious changes can finally take place. However, what I can observe, which is beautiful, is that the younger generation (not all but many) are already sensitized to this topic and really want to deal with it and it becomes a matter of the heart. This is incredibly beautiful to see! Education plays a very important role here, worldwide. We ALL need to get rid of these conditionings, or let'`s say dogmas, so that we can move forward. But, to answer this question, a quote from Nina Simone (Eunice Waymon): ""What kept me sane was knowing that things would change, and it was a question of keeping myself together until they did."" We have to stick together and stick to it!"
10181,"My hopes would be that: All women in the world have free access to education. Abuse and mistreatment of women is taken seriously and more women'`s voices are heard regarding this and appropriate actions taken. Women feel able to protect their sexual and general health without fear of retribution. Women of all races, economic and social backgrounds are treated equally and have access to economic resources to support them in need. In particular, women should be able to be financially independent and access funding so they are not trapped in relationships of any kind (marriage/parents etc) if they are suffering abuse. More world leaders are female so that these issues are addressed, rather than relying on the status quo political patriarchy. That women can be at the forefront of the economic recovery from COVID, and prevent environmental disaster due to their input in climate change policies.

Women’s roles in the workforce should be equivalent to those of their male counterparts.  It means that the female perspective is represented for all policy making and decisions at the local and global level. It means that my students see women in positions of power and that decisions are made that reflect women and children rather than the generic white male perspective.  It means women don’t sit quietly at meetings and are not made to feel inadequate because they have to pause their career in order to raise their children, that women don’t feel guilty and not penalized for taking time off to raise their families.  That girls don’t have to accept the narrative that their bodies and how they look or how they dress or behave is more important than their achievements.  That men are accountable for their actions. That women feel like they have a valid and strong voice at the table rather than perpetuating the dominant male narrative.  I think everyone should read the book Invisible Women in order to understand how deeply engrained all decisions are made around the generic male. I fear for my daughter and for my son and the gender inequities that may exist when they are older.  Women’s rights mean mothers like myself do not have to leave an abusive and controlling husband and father in fear.  This is what I hope for."

The government also has to sto with cooperate welfare to businesses who do not generate significant amounts of new jobs per year.

Harsh punishment & rehab will be imposed on any man (including husbands) who physically hurts or sexually harasses a woman (rape included).

I’m probably egregiously forgetting something! "

10751,"These thoughts are specific to the UK, but would apply to many other places as well:\r\nSociety is more regenerative - with distributed power and based on renewable systems rather than endless growth.  \r\nCare and education work is a central focus and is well respected and rewarded - both in terms of employment and what is currently unpaid labour.\r\nCooperatives and social enterprises make up an increasing percentage of organisations.  Flexible working is the norm and allows people of all genders to have more fulfilling home lives and take part in care and other domestic work.\r\nWomen are better represented in positions of authority (politics, CEOs, heads of public bodies etc), but not as a result of '`acting like men'` - these job roles will change to be more flexible,  more collaborative, less competitive etc.\r\nEducation at all levels will include quality teaching about relationships, consent, civic rights and responsibilities, as well as skills like conflict resolution and good communication.\r\nChildren'`s toys and clothing will not be obviously gendered and gender-based social stigma around clothing, job roles, hobbies/interests etc will be reduced.\r\nSupport for victims of domestic abuse will be easily accessible and generous.\r\nThe vast majority of  new films released will pass the Bechdel test.\r\nTranswomen will be accepted as women and allies in feminist movements.\r\n\r\nI would like to see reproductive rights, education, political voice and economic freedom significantly improved for women across the world, but am not educated sufficiently to know what the details of that would look like."

10754,That our health care will catch up to men’s where all of our medical structures are based on male models and not females. Our symptoms vary to men in MANY health concerns and we get left for years with no treatment or help. 
10755,"At minimum? The ability to have better conversations and more allies around women'`s human rights. The recognition that our behaviours, opinions and decisions are respectable and something to be listened to, believed and actioned."
10756,
10757,"Equal numbers of men/women staying home with their children and taking care of housework; Equal numbers of women/men in representative government; increase in numbers of men in traditional “pink collar” work, like nursing, elementary teachers, and home healthcare"

10776,The ability for more women to be in key decision making positions.
10777,"In 10 years I vision women to be given same rights as men, because right now most women are discouraged by society that certain jobs aren'`t for them"
10778,I'`m just wishing for the best 
10779,I look at it at another angle cause I know it will progress 
10780,"At this rate, not much as the fight for women'`s rights is being viewed as a fight against men'`s rights which is leading to conflict. "

12103,Every woman will be able to be having an earning business
12104,Where women can voice their thoughts without be discriminated because of their gender
12105,"Women will have  a more louder voice when it comes parenting , politics and social \r\n status but for this to happen be will need to continue making it known even to those women who are in the interior rural areas and don'`t know their right especially when it come to time to get married , having right to access property and manage property as a wife,  ending rape ,the youth becoming more empowered in that they can be able to access national funds in a more easier way so as to grow, when they become more empowered they will not depend more on their parents."

12107,Better 
12108,Improvement
12109,Freedom
12110,Women are not fully empowered.
12111,A world where women are empowered to lead without prejudice
12112,Women should  be at the front in fighting gender based violence. They should be fully empowered  to participate in matters of peace building at the grassroots.
12113,
12114,100% equality
12115,It has greatly improved according to the way things could be back then now women have alot of liberty in quite alot of things or activities lately which wasn'`t the case way back.

12123,
12124,There is some improvement though a lot needs to be done
12125,In the next 10 years I look at women being free from domestic violence. Women to be independent and not dependent... 
12126,Ending violence against women.. Freedom to work and attain equal height as a man. Girl child education.. 
12127,The government is trying to put women'`s and progress into practice. Women are given special treatment in most of the areas.

12142,I think there will be justice and equality for women just like it is for men
12143,Very good
12144,Achievable
12145,I see a world where women'`s right are all given without a feel like it'`s a rule.... I want it to come naturally... just like right to life
12146,"For me,I will be a great female leader in my country"
12147,Its amazing.with too many women geting independently  and enjoying equality.\r\nAlthough  this has not been so possible in some villages in Africa
12148,It looks like its slowly progressing given the education that'`s bringing enlightenment to our male counterparts.
12149,Hard 
12150,Fully qualified and accepted 
12151,Same unless a drastic measures is taken.
12152,Gender gap Will be minimal
12153,"There is some little progress, meaning we still need much, more so in my country where good laws are promulgated together with good institutions like Equal Opportunities Commission but not effectively utilized. We also have discriminative cultures, religious beliefs that contradicts the law and so forth. Therefore in the 10 years progress is still low."
12154,Women will take the lead
12155,Women shall be freed of bondage
12156,There agreat progress for women'`s human rights 
12157,Every woman will have known their rights and be able to speak boldly!

12174,The future looks bright for women'`s rights
12175,I see women taking up important positions in our government. 
12176,It is achieveable if we work together with openness and accountability 
12177,
12178,I hope women will be able to voice out their dissatisfaction without fear and will be ready to take up leadership stands for each other
12179,Excellent
12180,"looks achievable, there may still be ways to go but we would definitely not be here."
12181,Not fair enough
12182,
12183,Paradigm shift
12184,
12185,
12186,Very impressive.
12187,The progress for women'`s human rights  in 10 years from would look more better if there would be changes by simply giving the right to all women like they deserve.
12188,Way better 
12189,
12190,
12191,
12192,Better 
12193,
12194,With in 10 years time I see violence and abuse of women coming to an end..
12195,I expect to have a female president in my Country.
12196,"I see us changing the narrative, speaking up and being champions in advocating for our human rights. Women will be the main thing that contribute to the success of our communities and country at large economically, politically and socially. We look forward to our times "

12204,
12205,Women to be counted also
12206,Atleast for the past 10 yrs. Women had been participating  in government position 
12207,Good
12208,"Progress for women'`s human rights in the past ten years in my country was a bit okay because it the former persistent Madam Ellen Johnson Selief who was serving as president of which she did all she could to encourage and promote women to get jobs, go to school politics, and to do business and.as comparing to the present women are finding it hard to get jobs,   to go to school etc"
12209,Very bad
12210,
12211,
12212,
12213,"A place where women are respected and valued,in my community women are second option"
12214,The will be a total freedom and acceptance for women'`s right in ten years time because a lot of awareness are available to women in terms of training and skills acquisition.
12215,Am hopeful the violators will repent. I see so few abuses in 10 years
12216,Women will be in a better place in terms of empowerment and they will be leaders too. 
12217,"Women will fully be engaged into politics, making their presence felt by discussing the ills in society."
12218,Women are still looked down upon... especially in Africa.... we found young girls being married to older men becouse of poverty 
12219,"Within the next ten years, women will be privilege to  contribute hugely in the society.  \r\n\r\nContribution like:\r\nHelping in structuring the society, \r\nWorking in higher offices that will allowed one to give sufficient impact. "
12220,
12221,Women will be able to stand for their true rights with no fear
12222,"More women in leadership positions\r\nReduction in GBV especially SGBV\r\nEqual pay for women compared to male counterparts\r\nReproductive justice, body autonomy and freedom to choose over their own bodies"
12223,
12224,
12225,It how improve the women who are unable to speak for the right and make them to be able to stand for themselves
12226,Yeah! Women have been librated n enpowered
12227,

12233,
12234,Total recoil
12235,
12236,
12237,
12238,The progress for women'`s  human rights for me in 10 years  look really difficult because society haven'`t adjusted to the importance of women issues. 
12239,
12240,More participation in civic education
12241,Significant progress
12242,
12243,"It'`s has be good during time of our president Ellen Johnson .women had rights n Justice at that time . No violence against women , no insult on us n everyone has equal right ."
12244,
12245,
12246,Seeing a free gender based violence society whereby women  and men will have equal rights and free from violence and harassment 
12247,Success
12248,nothing 
12249,A world where every woman can be heard and be self sufficient. 
12250,Its better than before
12251,Our children in prison for nothing
12252,If join together as women we will make it
12253,Looks like women will have enough opportunities in all sectors 
12254,Freedom
12255,Women will be vibrant in most fields dominated by men 
12256,Progressing  we should have good platform to make our voice strong nd United\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
12257,Achievable
12258,Pale
12259,"10 years back, it was nothing. woman don'`t have any rights. When molested they are silent.\r\nBut women can now stand up for themselves. Though not 100% yet but there is a high increase of women that will not let their right be shut down, many organisation have created awareness and support women to stand up. I believe in few years to come woman right will no longer be shut out. Women will have a voice that will be heard."
12260,Even though people are trying to put things in place against women violence but is not progressively enforce
12261,They should push harder to reach women . every corner of the country but they are trying
12262,Equality 
12263,"Some people don'`t still believe that women have the right to be educated or to make decisions,they still believe that women are subjected to them"
12264,
12265,There'`s progress but slow
12266,It will have improved
12267,I believe in 10 years to come  the progress for women'`s human rights will improve greatly because evidence point to the vast changed comparing to previous decades.
12268,Women human right will be achieved in 10years d awareness is huge here\r\n
12269,It will definitely get better
12270,"Women are able to make choices on their sexual reproductive health and as women, we are able to walk around comfortably without worrying about what we'`ve worn or who will harass us, regardless of how short or unconventional it may be."
12271,The women progress will be at it best if men are all involved at all levels 
12272,Yielding a great future
12273,
12274,If women can empower the self they can become leaders 
12275,
12276,More big positions for women at working places
12277,I see huge progress because women’s inclusion in all sectors is becoming an awareness 
12278,"If there is no change in the narrative now, eventually women will be denied the rights completely. "
12279,
12280,20%
12281,Should have equal rights as men
12282,Good\r\n
12283,Increase women right in the community
12284,I don'`t know 
12285,"That a woman, does not have to choose between family and career. That we can have high flying careers and great families at the same time. "

12292,Positive progress 
12293,
12294,Sure its great because its base is the woman
12295,Slim. In my country women are less recognized

12297,
12298,Women being able to attain more leadership positions in society
12299,
12300,Utmost priority
12301,Positive
12302,In ten years women human right will be progressive but not fully achieved
12303,Great
12304,For me women'`s human rights progress has stop man from taking \r\n disadvantage of women.
12305,That the voice of women around the world will be heard.\r\nWomen and Young girls will be decision makers.\r\nWomen will be the lead political leaders in the world.
12306,Ensuring women are free from war torn areas
12307,
12308,Some change
12309,There is a lot more work to be done. Which means that woman will still face abuses if a step isnot taken
12310,Perfect
12311,achi
12312,It'`s been slow but women are now beginning to understand that their voices needs to be heard and they are now willing to shout and seek help that would empower them through freedom and making choices for themselves
12313,increasing
12314,A situation whereby there will be uniformity in our country
12315,Impressive 
12316,Being empowered
12317,"In 10years every girl-child will be empowered if we stay strong and believe that we as women can achieve all that we set our minds too.\r\nWe are the backbone of this world'`s economy,  in every 3 in 10 teenage girls has suffered sexual violence from a known relative or neighbors,we need to fight for our rights and ensure that there is no violence against women and girls and justice is served to the victim.\r\nAm sure we will achieve our rights by 80% in 10years."
12318,
12319,
12320,Woman empowerment 
12321,Not in good shape 
12322,Improved access to resources.improvement in women'`s economic status and  leteracy levels
12323,
12324,Looks good 
12325,"Where women and men have equal opportunity, access and most of  all recognized as equal human beings to  men"
12326,Perfect 
12327,Good and I want it\r\n
12328,
12329,Ots been positively progressive
12330,Not good\r\n
12331,The progress will be better   as compared  to now  for I believe  as time goes by there is learning of new things  as we get more digitised  thus people will be more educated  and know about their individual rights .\r\nBut still there will  still be a few issues on  women'`s human rights. \r\nEducating women is the best  way.
12332,
12333,Not good
12334,Gender equality 
12335,givimg women voices
12336,"Progress for women'`s human right will look like in ten years,as for me I will suggest that more women be into politics and our voices should be heard."
12337,Looks bad for me
12338,It is progressing
12339,There has been major progress in education and freedom of speech.
12340,I think by then women should be given 100% recognition in all levels in the society.
12341,Women are standing up for their rights.. we have a bright future where women will be treated as equals with men
12342,"In ten(10), it will make us women to know our value in society. And set a legesay for our generation that will come after us"

12372,Women and men should be seen as equals and given the same opportunities especially in Africa.
12373,It will look like a great accomplishment for me
12374,I think it will have improved a great deal making women feel equal to men in terms of job etc.. thus women will have a say in this world
12375,Bad
12376,Women will take their place in the public affairs of the nation.
12377,It will be justifiable in 10 years
12378,To get freedom
12379,It better than where we were but we still have a long way to go
12380,"Women are doing it, it'`s positive, brighter future for women "

12382,It'`s our main prospectives and function of our raign\r\n in life\r\n\r\n\r\n
12383,I have been fighting for it dearly to achieve my goals but all in all am gaining strength n mirage day by day
12384,With resilience and great progress to celebrate 
12385,
12386,"In ten years, I want to see women standing up for themselves, and society giving women the respect they deserve. \r\nWomen should be given equal opportunities as men, and should be protected. "
12387,Being able to get same respect a man in my field with same qualifications gets mainly because of his gender 
12388,"Women should be to say what is their minds, they should be able to contest for any position,  they should not be victimized when they lost their husbands. The rate of rape should have reduced to the barest minimum. There should be gender equality. Etc."
12389,I think in 10 years women should be able to stand up for themselves. No gender discrimination.
12390,>Equality in the professional fields.\r\n>Women to stop being sexualised above everything else they can offer.\r\n>Women to be able to be themselves without being called ha4d to deal with because they fight for what they deserve.\r\n>Female children esp teens to stop being raped. There should be very heavy punishment for pedophiles.

12402,Women having equal pay and applying for work similar opportunities with men.
12403,Women to be involved in consensus of all the world affairs

12418,I expect there to be a noticeable change because the beginning from here started to be better 
12419,I see equality in all without gender bias
12420,At least to a smaller extent women'`s human rights have been considered & abit given respect since most women now can stand & fight for their rights
12421,"It is important for me, because these days a lot men find pleasure in abusing women. \r\nHaving women'`s human rights  for 10 years is something great."
12422,Awareness
12423,"Speaking from experience back home, I see girls not dropping out of school because of getting married , women run business that uplift other women, health care for all expectant mothers, sex education not being a taboo for girls, in conclusion growth and liberty in education, business, governance, the family unit and self."

12478,
12479,Reduced number of violations.
12480,That would be a very good thing.
12481,It'`s look better n promising because of the hard work is going on. Thanks to those few persons trying  for us all
12482,To show women how beneficial it is to assert themselves; To live fearlessly; To think highly of women and appreciate  their contributions;

12493,Women being part of decision making in all aspects and inclusion of their interests in key strategies 
12494,It will be a better support for women who are silent
12495,Positive progress hence end violence against women
12496,According  to me women'`s Human Rights has been ignored somewhere somehow  most women  when they run to police for help they end up  being  abused sexually  again in order to get help.

In zimbabwe we have 3 women raped and tortured for political views now on trial for reporting it. While around the word every news camera focuses on George Floyd. Girls in Nigeria were stolen from school and barely get a mention on the world stage. Cervical cancer is the leading cause of death of women in the 3rd world. Young mothers dying in the most painful and undignified manner.. even though an hpv vaccine exists so few have access. If we want equality in the next 10 years we need to admit that western lives are valued far more and those in developing countries.  Only when all life is valued can we begin to achieve equality.

16504,"Progress for me will look like this - girls are not forced from infancy that they should have children and stay at home. Women will not be told that they cannot and should not do things that they may not have done before. In Russia, there will be no list of professions prohibited for women. And in general, I will be able to do what I want and in the clothes in which I want, and if someone tells me that this is not what it is, I can sue. Just like that. "
16505,"Over the past 10 years, women'`s rights in Afghanistan have improved to some degree, and women have gained the right to be involved in national and other issues, but my fear is that we will not lose the progress we have achieved over the past decade with the coming of the Taliban. "

16571,I would like to see more children created for women who have children. Many mothers can'`t go out to work because they'`re sitting with their kids.

16576,"Taking into account that the Civid-19 pandemic, by destroying jobs has essentially affected the social sector ( Nurseries, children'`s centers, some health posts , limitations in the street sale of products due to the rules of containment of the pandemic etc.  ) which employs mostly women in my country, to anticipate considerable progress in women'`s human rights, particularly economic, social and political (participation in public life and decision-making) would be utopian, since the country'`s own economic and political-partisan context is still very much focused on exclusion and employability priorities for women to have sources of income or are enhanced in what they already do do not always obey  criteria based on their technical and professional skills. On the other hand, government policies in my country are not yet sensitive to these issues. There are no clear policies for the development of women .\r\n\r\r\nBut, I think, if there are ways of conferring knowledge that enable them to adapt to the current context and new technologies, it would be a decisive step in reversing the not-so-optimistic picture that can be foreseen, as far as the progress of women'`s human rights is concerned."

As far is my country equal rights are being emplimated far that even the boy child is being dissadvantaged but still the ladies we are not doing something productive. We need to know that we are worth something on our own cause ladies still think being married is a goal in life.
17832,

17834,
17835,"Equal pay, more women in leadership positions, especially in politics, greatly lowered child marriages and accountability when it comes to sexual abuse-related cases"

17862,
17863,
17864,
17865,I think gender equality and equity will be highly practiced 
17866,
17867,"We live in a part of the world where women, compared to men, are always considered inferior on all levels (gender equality, physical, moral and even intellectual capacity, abilities to be a learder, etc.). In short, women are always classified, in most cases, as housewives and even when some work, they mostly do small businesses where they occupy very small positions in the structures. In Cameroon, for example, just a small handful have been able to gain height, but have not yet reached the expectations of the summit.\r\n\r\n Talking about the progress of women'`s human rights, in our opinion, would be tantamount to balancing positions in government and private structures because women must be given the opportunity to prove,  to demonstrate their abilities and strengths.\r\n\r\nIt will also be a question of putting the education of the girl child at the same level as that of the boys, both at the family level and at the school level."
17868,
17869,
17870,
17871,Nothing because women are increasingly marginalized

17922,"Here in Zimbabwe I dont think much will have changed,,some of the causes of violence against women are propelled by the economic situation,,,poor living conditions,inability of the man to provide for the wife and child leading him to be violent towards them.

With current blame games on women'`s rights issues in Liberia, it has the propensity in getting worse.

And fortunately, I grew up in an enlightened family where a lot of people don'`t have this chance, my dear father has encouraged us to study and study all the time, despite all the problems that are going on. \r\n Human rights in our country is one of the most incompetent institutions I know, and I haven'`t seen any interesting work from them to date.

The gender ideology have pushed back women'`s rights by decades and all female spaces have now been invaded and taken over by dicks.  Your questions 5 and 6 are insulting because women cannot identify themselves out of sex-based or racial oppression. If you really want to work for women'`s rights, focus on females and only females."
23158,
23159,Will be a bit better
23160,Equality in every sense
23161,"Women are 50% of CEO’s of Fortune 500 companies. Women can choose their birth control. Violence (homicide, rape) against women ends.. Human sex trafficking ends. Bullying in the workplace against women (and men) is no longer accepted and  is a crime."

23207,To continue as until now very slow although women are empowering themselves there is still a lot of abuse of power 
23208,"If we do not educate, train and sensitize, women'`s rights will be in clear decline "
23209,"That in reality women are respected, all over the world that there is no country that does not comply with this law, there is no violence against us."
