Of the issues concerning my country, I would like the interests of women to be better protected by the state. That domestic violence or violence on the street, anywhere, was punished. Now in my country, women can rarely win such a trial. And as a rule, their lives are already broken. I'`m glad there are community centers and foundations that are trying to help them.

Wonderful women who have become successful in their jobs but their homes are abandoned, and the formation of the home, the children in a total abandonment, passing the responsibility to the schools that lack educators suitable to form in values, where children and young people grow up without a true ethical and moral formation because the most important thing for many is to encourage the liveliness and the capture of wealth regardless of how,  where to teach self-respect and respect for your neighbor is set aside if it affects the economic benefit, not to mention the struggle for freedom of choice that is rather a struggle for debauchery where the abuses of alcohol, drugs, sex, physical violence, verbal violence reign to all who intend to correct situations. Seriously it is necessary to resume the importance of the concept of family, which is the main cell of society, when its importance is recognized, work will begin for its rescue, which is fundamental the role of women for the success of a family but responsibility of men as well.

Thus, it is of great importance to achieve the highest possible disengagement of the states from religion. I strongly believe that this would be a crucial step towards change.

She should understand that the ""good old times"" were not better, but the people there were younger.\r\nOmething of the most important thing seems to me, however, that it is understood that changes are part of life, that not everything can remain as before.

The developments worldwide so far are unbelievable to observe but also frightening! There is still so much ignorance and disinterest in this very important topic and the ignorance is very great. I think 10 years is far too short a period of time to be able to foresee a quasi-glorious future. It will take 2-3 more generations before serious changes can finally take place. However, what I can observe, which is beautiful, is that the younger generation (not all but many) are already sensitized to this topic and really want to deal with it and it becomes a matter of the heart. This is incredibly beautiful to see! Education plays a very important role here, worldwide. We ALL need to get rid of these conditionings, or let'`s say dogmas, so that we can move forward. But, to answer this question, a quote from Nina Simone (Eunice Waymon): ""What kept me sane was knowing that things would change, and it was a question of keeping myself together until they did."" We have to stick together and stick to it!"
UK,woman,white,35 to 44,en,"My hopes would be that: All women in the world have free access to education.

Women feel able to protect their sexual and general health without fear of retribution. Women of all races, economic and social backgrounds are treated equally and have access to economic resources to support them in need. In particular, women should be able to be financially independent and access funding so they are not trapped in relationships of any kind (marriage/parents etc) if they are suffering abuse. More world leaders are female so that these issues are addressed, rather than relying on the status quo political patriarchy. That women can be at the forefront of the economic recovery from COVID, and prevent environmental disaster due to their input in climate change policies. That'`s a lot to achieve in 10 years I realise. But I live in hope, and solidarity with women across the world. "

In Cameroon, for example, just a small handful have been able to gain height, but have not yet reached the expectations of the summit.\r\n\r\n Talking about the progress of women'`s human rights, in our opinion, would be tantamount to balancing positions in government and private structures because women must be given the opportunity to prove,  to demonstrate their abilities and strengths.\r\n\r\nIt will also be a question of putting the education of the girl child at the same level as that of the boys, both at the family level and at the school level."

UA,woman,white,35 to 44,uk,Article 21 of the Constitution of Ukraine determines that all people are free and equal in their dignity and rights. Human rights and freedoms are inseparable and inviolable. Observance of the rights and freedoms of a person has become one of the most important priority principles of an independent Ukrainian state. \r\nThe biggest problem with ensuring human rights in Ukraine arises from imperfections or the lack of separate links or institutions of the legal protection mechanism that has long been in force in many democracies in Europe.
